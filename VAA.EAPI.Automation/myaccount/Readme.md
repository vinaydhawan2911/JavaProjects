In this structure:

The pages package contains the Page Object classes, 
each representing a page on the Virgin Atlantic website.

The utils package contains utility classes for managing the test configuration, 
test data, and other common functionalities.

The tests package contains the actual test classes, such as FlightSearchTest

The TestSuite class is responsible for organizing and executing the test suite.

The config.properties file stores the test configuration, 
such as browser driver paths and URLs.

The flight-search-data.csv file stores the test data for the flight search tests.

The pom.xml file manages the project dependencies and build process.

The testng.xml file defines the test suite and execution parameters.

This is a high-level overview of the automation framework. 
You would need to implement the details of each component based 
on your specific requirements and the Virgin Atlantic website's structure 
and functionality.
